*Note: The reference course provides extensive material on representation learning and is highly recommended for deeper understanding.*

## ðŸ“Š Grading System
The laboratory/project portion accounts for 60% of the final course grade, broken down as follows:

- Paper Summary: 0-10 points
- Project Work: 0-35 points
- Activity Points: 0-5 points (and optional tasks after each lecture)

Final Grade Scale:
| Points | Grade |
|--------|--------|
| 26-30 | 3.0 |
| 31-35 | 3.5 |
| 36-40 | 4.0 |
| 41-45 | 4.5 |
| 46-50 | 5.0 |

## ðŸ“… Course Structure
The plan is to have 9 hours of lectures (I will use both laboratory and project hours) and at 10th hour we will finish discussing the project topic and formulating the groups. Next two hours of laboratory will be dedicated to paper writing workshop and the rest of the time will be for the project work and report. The course will be divided into three main parts:

## Part 1: Theoretical Foundations
Here we will cover the basics of representation learning with topics such as self-supervised learning, contrastive learning, masked-based representation and interpretable representation learning. I will focus on foundations and various state-of-the-art methods in the field.

## Part 2: Paper Writing Workshop
- Group 2: Wednesday, 2025-04-09 and 2025-04-16
- Group 3: Tuesday, 2025-04-08 and 2025-04-15

In this part, we will focus on the paper writing journey. 
I will show you how the process of writing a paper looks like and what are the most important things to remember. 
I will also provide you with some tips and tricks on how to write a good paper. After this lecture, you will have to choose a paper and write a short summary of it with paraphrasing.

**Deadline**: Group 2 2025-04-30; Group 3 2025-04-29

**Paper Summary Requirements** (Due 2 weeks after this Writing lecture)
- Section-by-section summary (3 points)
- Summary of the review process of the paper (1 point)
- Clear contribution statement and what results prove the contribution (1 point)
- Author background research (who they are, from where, number of citations and main domain of research of each author) (1 point)
- Analysis of papers that have cited the summary paper with focus on why they cited this paper (min. 3 papers, 2 points)
- Overall quality assessment (2 points)
