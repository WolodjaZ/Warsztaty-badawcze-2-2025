    "# Exercise Week 5 - Interpretable Representation Learning\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we trained our first (maybe) self-supervised learning (SSL) model using rotation as a pretext task. Later, on a dataset of road signs, you tested how a fine-tuned SSL model performed comparably to a model trained from scratch with respect to the downstream task evaluation (road sign prediction). You could evaluate which supervised or self-supervised approach is better when we have a small amount of labeled data but a decent amount of unlabeled data. You also learned two evaluation methods in this task: using linear probing (freezing the model and training a classifier with features extracted from the SSL model) and fine-tuning on various downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you explored two other popular evaluation methods: using UMAP and t-SNE to map high-dimensional features to 2D space and visualize them, which enables visual understanding of how samples are distributed and how linear probing can be successful. The second approach is an alternative to linear probing, using a KNN classifier to evaluate the features extracted from the model. In the previous exercise, you evaluated models like a pro on several downstream tasks and datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the last exercise, the cherry on the cake, this exercise is an ensemble of previous exercises where you will train your SSL model alongside a model from scratch and evaluate the features from both models on other downstream tasks with tools learned from previous exercises. However, now we are getting our hands on an SSL method which is well established in the SSL world and which you should already know from our lectures: [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709). Your task will be to train two SSL models on the dataset with road signs alongside a model trained from scratch. We will be using an even smaller classification dataset than previously, and you will train models and compare them. To check everything we've done in previous exercises, we will also test how features from our models transfer to two other downstream tasks.\n",

    "Now for a very important part: making results reproducible by seeding the random number generators. In the code below, we set all the random number generators to the same seed. This is crucial for the reproducibility of results. You can change the seed to any number you want, but make sure to set it to the same number in all cells where random operations occur. For those who are still unfamiliar with this concept, understanding random seeding is essential knowledge for ML practitioners. Setting a fixed seed ensures that random operations (like weight initialization, data shuffling, etc.) produce the same results each time the code is run, which allows for consistent and comparable experiments."

The dataset contains 43 classes of traffic signs, with a total of approximately 50,000 images. The images are in color, and we will resize them to 224x224 pixels. The dataset is split into training and test sets, with about 39,209 images in the training set and 12,630 images in the test set. We will use **90%** of the training set for training our SSL models and the remaining **10%** for the classification task. The test set will be used for the evaluation of all models.\n",
